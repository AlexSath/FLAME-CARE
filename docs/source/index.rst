CARE for FLAME
==============

A repository for using Content-Aware Image Restoration (CARE) to digitally enhance signal to noise ratio in images 
taken using a Fast, Large-Area Multiphoton Exoscope (FLAME).

This repository doesn't propose any new methodological innovations. Instead, it attempts to provide a simple and robust
platform for CARE model training and deployment. To understand the underlying technology, please visit the original
`FLAME <www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75172-9>`_ and `CARE <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0216-7>`_ 
publications.
