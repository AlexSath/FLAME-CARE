MLFlow
^^^^^^
`MLFlow <https://mlflow.org/docs/2.2.2/>`_ is a platform for managing machine learning lifecycles. As projects grow along with datasets,
scientists can often grow overwhelmed by the number of parameters that need to be tracked to understand the training, inference, and
performance of any given model in their project. **The purpose of MLFlow in CARE for FLAME is to provide infrastructure to track these
parameters and simplify decision-making in choosing a model for FLAME image denoising in the clinic**.

Synology Drive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Repository is built for Synology Drive, but other model version control repositories are available through MLFlow including AWS and 
SQL-based servers.
